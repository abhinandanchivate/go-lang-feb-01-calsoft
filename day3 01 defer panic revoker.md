## **Conditional Execution Using `defer`, `panic`, and `recover` in Go**
## ** Best Practices for Using panic, defer, and recover

### **Execution Sequence of `panic`, `defer`, and `recover` in Go**
Understanding how `panic`, `defer`, and `recover` execute in Go is crucial for handling unexpected errors efficiently. Let's break it down with a clear **step-by-step execution sequence and a diagram**.

---

## **1. Execution Flow Overview**
1. **Normal execution starts**.
2. If a **`panic` occurs**, Go **stops normal execution** and starts unwinding the function stack.
3. **`defer` functions are executed in LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) order**.
4. If a `recover()` is inside a `defer`, it **catches** the panic and **resumes normal execution**.
5. If there is **no `recover()`**, the program **crashes with an error message**.

---

## **2. Example: `panic`, `defer`, and `recover` Execution Order**
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Start of main")

    defer fmt.Println("Defer 1: This executes before exiting main") 
    defer func() {
        if r := recover(); r != nil {
            fmt.Println("Recover: Caught panic:", r)
        }
    }()
    defer fmt.Println("Defer 2: Last-In, First-Out execution")

    fmt.Println("Before panic")
    panic("Something went wrong!")  // Panic occurs here
    fmt.Println("After panic")      // This won't execute

    defer fmt.Println("Defer 3: This will not execute")
    
    fmt.Println("End of main")      // This won't execute
}
```

---

## **3. Step-by-Step Execution Flow**
| Step | Execution |
|------|-----------|
| 1 | `"Start of main"` is printed. |
| 2 | `defer fmt.Println("Defer 1")` is registered. |
| 3 | `defer recover()` is registered (this will catch the panic). |
| 4 | `defer fmt.Println("Defer 2")` is registered. |
| 5 | `"Before panic"` is printed. |
| 6 | `panic("Something went wrong!")` is triggered. |
| 7 | Normal execution **stops**, and Go starts unwinding the stack. |
| 8 | `defer fmt.Println("Defer 2")` executes **first** (LIFO order). |
| 9 | `defer recover()` executes and **catches the panic**. |
| 10 | `"Recover: Caught panic: Something went wrong!"` is printed. |
| 11 | `defer fmt.Println("Defer 1")` executes next. |
| 12 | Since the panic was **recovered**, execution **resumes** normally. |
| 13 | `"End of main"` is printed. |

### **Final Output:**
```
Start of main
Before panic
Defer 2: Last-In, First-Out execution
Recover: Caught panic: Something went wrong!
Defer 1: This executes before exiting main
End of main
```
- `defer` functions execute in **reverse order** (LIFO).
- `recover()` **catches the panic**, allowing `"End of main"` to execute.

## **4. Execution Sequence with a Diagram**
### **Function Call Stack During Execution**
```
Step 1: Normal execution
+----------------------+
| main()              |
+----------------------+

Step 2: Defer statements registered (LIFO order)
+----------------------+
| defer fmt.Println("Defer 1") |
| defer recover()               |
| defer fmt.Println("Defer 2")  |
+----------------------+

Step 3: `panic("Something went wrong!")`
+----------------------+
| panic() occurs       |
+----------------------+

Step 4: Stack unwinding (defer functions execute in LIFO)
+----------------------+
| Defer 2 executes     |  <- First to execute
| Recover executes     |  <- Catches the panic
| Defer 1 executes     |
+----------------------+

Step 5: Execution resumes normally
+----------------------+
| "End of main"       |
+----------------------+
```

## **5. `panic`, `defer`, and `recover` Execution Flow Summary**
| Feature | Execution Order |
|---------|---------------|
| **Normal Statements** | Execute sequentially until a `panic` occurs. |
| **Defer Statements** | Stored in **LIFO order** (Last-In, First-Out). |
| **Panic Trigger** | Stops normal execution and unwinds the stack. |
| **Recover Function** | If present inside `defer`, it **catches panic** and resumes execution. |
| **Program End** | If `recover()` is called, execution resumes; otherwise, the program crashes. |

---

## **6. Best Practices for Using `panic`, `defer`, and `recover`**
### ✅ **Good Practices**
- Always use `defer` to **clean up resources** (closing files, releasing locks).
- Use `recover()` **only at the top level** to catch panics and **prevent crashes**.
- Avoid using `panic` for normal errors; use `error` handling instead.

### ❌ **Bad Practices**
- Using `panic` for expected errors (use `error` instead).
- Relying on `recover()` **too often** (only use in critical areas like HTTP handlers).
- Placing `recover()` **outside `defer`** (it will not work!).

---

## **7. Practical Use Case: Recovering in a Web Server**
To prevent a web server from crashing due to panics, `recover()` is used.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
)

func safeHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    defer func() {
        if err := recover(); err != nil {
            fmt.Fprintf(w, "Recovered from panic: %v", err)
        }
    }()

    panic("Server Error!") // Simulate server panic
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", safeHandler)
    fmt.Println("Starting server on :8080")
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

### **Behavior:**
- If an error occurs inside `safeHandler`, `recover()` catches it, preventing a crash.

---

## **8. Final Recap**
### **Execution Order**
1. Normal execution proceeds **until `panic` is encountered**.
2. Go **starts stack unwinding**, executing **defer functions in LIFO order**.
3. If a **`recover()` is inside `defer`**, it catches the panic, **stopping the program from crashing**.
4. Execution resumes **after the recovered panic**.
5. If `recover()` is **not used**, the program **crashes**.

🚀 Would you like additional **examples** with goroutines or concurrency handling?
### **1. Understanding `defer`, `panic`, and `recover`**
These three mechanisms allow Go to handle **error-prone execution flows** effectively:

| **Keyword** | **Purpose** |
|-------------|------------|
| `defer` | Schedules a function call to run **after the surrounding function completes**, useful for cleanup operations. |
| `panic` | Terminates the program execution immediately, but **deferred functions still run** before exit. |
| `recover` | Catches a `panic`, **prevents the program from crashing**, and allows graceful error handling. |

---

## **2. `defer` - Executing Cleanup Operations**

### **🔹 Concept**
- `defer` schedules a function to run **at the end of the enclosing function**.
- Typically used for **resource cleanup** (e.g., closing files, unlocking mutexes, database connections).

### **🔹 Example: Ensuring File Closure**
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    file, err := os.Open("example.txt")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error opening file:", err)
        return
    }
    defer file.Close() // Ensures file is closed before function exits

    fmt.Println("File opened successfully")
}
```
Execution Sequence:
Step 1: os.Open("example.txt") attempts to open the file.
Step 2: If an error occurs (err != nil), the program enters the if block.
Step 3: Prints "Error opening file: <error_message>" if the file does not exist or cannot be accessed.
Step 4: Calls return, exiting the main function immediately if an error occurs.
Step 5: If no error occurs, defer file.Close() is executed, scheduling file.Close() to run at the end of main().
Step 6: "File opened successfully" is printed.
🔹 **Why use `defer`?**
- Ensures `file.Close()` is **executed even if an early return or error occurs**.
- Improves **code readability** (close operation is placed near open operation).

---

## **3. `panic` - Handling Critical Errors**
### **🔹 Concept**
- `panic` **stops normal execution** and **runs deferred functions** before exiting.
- Used for **unexpected, unrecoverable errors** (e.g., out-of-bounds access, nil pointer dereference).

### **🔹 Example: Manually Triggering a Panic**
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Start of program")

    panic("Something went wrong!") // Terminates program

    fmt.Println("This will never execute")
}
```
🔹 **Why use `panic`?**
- Indicates a **severe error** that should not happen.
- Used for **assertions** and scenarios where continuing execution **is dangerous**.

---

## **4. `recover` - Preventing Program Crash**
### **🔹 Concept**
- `recover` **catches a panic** and **prevents the program from terminating**.
- Must be called inside a `defer` function.

### **🔹 Example: Recovering from a Panic**
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    defer func() {
        if r := recover(); r != nil {
            fmt.Println("Recovered from panic:", r)
        }
    }()

    fmt.Println("Before panic")
    panic("Critical Error!") // Execution jumps to deferred function
    fmt.Println("After panic") // This will not execute
}
```
🔹 **Why use `recover`?**
- Allows a program to **gracefully handle unexpected failures**.
- Used in **web servers, databases**, and **long-running applications** to **prevent complete crashes**.

---

## **5. Combining `defer`, `panic`, and `recover`**
### **Example: Graceful Error Handling in a Function**
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func safeDivide(a, b int) {
    defer func() {
        if r := recover(); r != nil {
            fmt.Println("Recovered from:", r)
        }
    }()

    if b == 0 {
        panic("Division by zero is not allowed")
    }

    fmt.Println("Result:", a/b)
}

func main() {
    safeDivide(10, 2)  // Works normally
    safeDivide(5, 0)   // Triggers panic, but recovered
    fmt.Println("Program continues execution")
}
```
🔹 **Key Takeaways**:
- If `b == 0`, `panic` is triggered.
- `recover()` catches the panic and prevents the program from crashing.

## **6. Where to Use `defer`, `panic`, and `recover`?**
| **Use Case** | **When to Use?** |
|-------------|----------------|
| **`defer`** | - Closing files, releasing locks, database connections cleanup. <br> - Ensuring function execution order. |
| **`panic`** | - Unrecoverable errors: corrupt memory, missing critical resources. <br> - Unexpected system failures. |
| **`recover`** | - Prevent crashes in critical applications. <br> - Handling panics inside web servers, API handlers, goroutines. |

---

## **7. Practical Example: Error Handling in a Web Server**
### **Example: Preventing Web Server Crash with `recover`**
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
)

func safeHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    defer func() {
        if err := recover(); err != nil {
            fmt.Println("Recovered from panic:", err)
            http.Error(w, "Internal Server Error", http.StatusInternalServerError)
        }
    }()

    panic("Unexpected server error!") // Simulate crash
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", safeHandler)
    fmt.Println("Server started on :8080")
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```
🔹 **Why is this important?**
- Prevents **one failed request** from crashing the entire server.
- Ensures **high availability**.

---

## **8. Final Summary**
| **Concept**  | **What It Does?** | **Best Use Cases** |
|--------------|------------------|--------------------|
| `defer` | Executes a function **at the end of the current function** | Resource cleanup, logging, finalization. |
| `panic` | **Immediately stops execution** and runs deferred functions before exit | Fatal errors, assertions, invalid states. |
| `recover` | Catches and handles **panic errors** to prevent crashes | Web servers, long-running apps, Goroutines. |
